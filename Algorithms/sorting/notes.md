# Notes on sorting algorithms 

-`Stable` mean if two numbers is equal ,there order will not change 

## Insertion Sort
- T(n) = o(n^2)
- S(n) = o(1)
- Stable 
- incremental approach
- put every number in it's correct place 
## merge Sort
- T(n) = theta(nlogn)
- S(n) = theta(n)
- Stable 
- divide and conquer approach
- split array to small arrays and sort

## quick Sort
- T(n) = o(n^2) , omega(nlogn)
- S(n) = o(1)
- Stable Not 
- divide and conquer approach
- you have pivot -> sort array to that pivot -> put pivot in right place -> swap -> repeat
